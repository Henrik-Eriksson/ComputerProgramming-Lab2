# ComputerProgramming-Lab2

The lab assignment is focused on arrays, strings, modules, pointers, and memory management in computer programming. It's divided into three problems:

* Problem 1: Create an 'intarray' module for managing integer arrays, involving a special sentinel value to indicate the array's end.

* Problem 2: Develop a 'fmatrix' module for handling 3x3 floating-point matrices allocated on the heap, emphasizing memory management.

* Problem 3: Utilize both modules in a main program, demonstrating their functionalities through specific tasks like appending and interleaving integer arrays, sorting arrays, adding, and multiplying matrices.

The assignment requires careful separation of interface and implementation, appropriate use of data types, pointers, string functions, memory management, and clear documentation through comments. The grading criteria focus on completeness, design quality, code organization, and adherence to the taught principles. The final submission must be a zipped file containing all source code.
